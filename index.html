                <p>The moment I realized that "home" isn't just a place‚Äîit's the feeling of belonging that comes from connecting with students and communities anywhere in the world.

We shared homesickness over cheap Korean BBQ, celebrated small classroom victories together, and supported each other through the challenges of being foreigners trying to make a difference.
