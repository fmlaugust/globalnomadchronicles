      <h3>School nurse and foreign teacher communication; moment of confusion in my Korean school</h3>

    <div class="blog-content">
        <p class="blog-intro">How a simple misunderstanding about a "Korean teacher" between me and the school nurse taught me that communication transcends language barriers and common sense, and why this moment changed my entire approach to cultural immersion.</p>
        
        <h3>The Unexpected Communication Barrier</h3>
        <p>I had a LOT of "Black Barbie Moments"‚Äîthose instances where my American perspective hilariously (or sometimes awkwardly) clashed with my new life in Korea. This one, which happened a couple of weeks ago, truly took the cake.</p>
        
        <p>I genuinely loved my time there at Sung Kwang Middle/High School in Daegu, South Korea. Everyone had been incredibly welcoming, with the notable exception of Mr. Kim, affectionately known as HKIC (Head Korean in Charge, I assumed). However, after enjoying some quality time with my delightful handler, Moon Yeoung Park (he was a real sweetie), I had managed to forge a friendship with the school nurse, who also happened to be a Mrs. Kim. Seriously, sometimes I thought this country just decided to use four surnames and call it a day.</p>
        
        <p>On a deeper level, I started to suspect that living there was slowly eroding the basic common sense I once possessed. I desperately wished I could have blamed this particular incident on jet lag, but no, I was perfectly well-rested. This exchange unfolded while the nurse was kindly giving me a tour of the school and introducing me to various staff members. What transpired next, I'm sure, left the poor woman wondering if all Americans were as spectacularly ignorant as I was in that moment.</p>


        <h3>The School Nurse, The Mr. Kims, and Me: A Korean "Who's on First"</h3>
        <p>The conversation went something like this:</p>
        <p></p>

    Nurse: "This is so and so and so and so." <br>
    Me: "Oh. Who is he?" <br>
    Nurse: "That's Mr. Kim. He's the Korean teacher." <br>
    Me: "Oh okay. What does he teach?" <br>
    Nurse: "He's the Korean teacher." <br>
    Me: "Yes, I know, but what does he teach?" <br>
    Nurse: "He's the Korean teacher."
</p>        
<p>
    We continued this bewildering, Abbot and Costello-esque "Who's on First" routine, Korean style, for a solid two minutes. Instead of being a comedic bit, we were both dead serious, utterly bewildered as to why the other couldn't grasp such a simple question and answer. By this point, the nurse had the most profoundly puzzled look on her face. She was scrutinizing me as if to question how on earth I managed to board a plane by myself and actually arrive in the country. I could almost see the thoughts swirling in her head: Is she sick? Crazy? Stupid? Or worse, has she completely lost her mind here in Korea, thousands of miles from home?

        <blockquote>
            <p>"My brain cells during that conversation: 'Error 404: Common Sense Not Found'."</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>The Breakthrough Moment (and the Nurse's Dubious Confirmation)</h3>
        <p>It was a combination of her increasingly bewildered facial expressions and our futile back-and-forth that finally, mercifully, clicked with yours truly.</p>
        <p>In that moment, I realized I had been approaching special education all wrong. I was trying to fit students into communication methods instead of finding the methods that fit each student.</p>
        <p>
    Me: "OHHHH!!! HE‚ÄôS THE KOREAN TEACHER!!! HE TEACHES KOREAN!" <br>
    Nurse: "Uh, yes." (She said, very slowly, as if addressing a small, easily confused child) "He teaches Korean." <br>
    Me: "I get it now."
</p>









        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Listen with your eyes:</strong> Non-verbal communication often says more than words</li>
            <li><strong>Meet students where they are:</strong> Don't force them to come to where you think they should be</li>
            <li><strong>Every child has a voice:</strong> Our job is to help them find their unique way to use it</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural barriers disappear</strong> when we focus on human connection first</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Impact</h3>
        <p>This experience completely transformed my teaching philosophy. I began incorporating more visual, tactile, and creative communication methods into all my classes. The results were remarkable ‚Äì not just for students with special needs, but for all learners.</p>
        
        <p>Min-jun taught me that the universal language of learning isn't Korean, English, or Arabic ‚Äì it's patience, creativity, and genuine human connection.</p>
